  Prepare Ubuntu 24.04 for NVIDIA Software stack setup
  ====================================================

  Performing these tasks, including the manual steps should take around 5mins.

  The entire DOCA host-stack is installed as it provides a convenient
  installation which covers the requirements of having OFED for GPU Direct
  Storage / nvidia-peermem.

  The nouveau driver is blacklisted.

  A couple of packages are installed.

  Then the system is rebooted.

  Misc. manual commands
  ---------------------

  By default then Ubuntu allows password-login over SSH, installs sudo and adds
  the user created during installation to sudoers. Thus, what is left is to
  allow root to login over SSH and to set a password for root.
  
  Something like this::

    echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/100-root.conf

    sudo passwd root

    sudo service ssh restart

  Assumptions
  -----------

  Ubuntu 24.04 is installed on the system.
