  This use of the 'qemu' shows how to initialize, start, and stop a qemu guest

  * Start the guest
  * Run a command within the guest (via SSH)
  * Stop the guest again

  This is done via scripts, which in turn are utilizing helper-functions from
  cijoe.qemu.wrapper.

steps:
- name: guest_kill
  uses: qemu.guest_kill
  with:
    guest_name: generic-bios-kvm-x86_64
  
- name: guest_start
  uses: qemu_guest_start_nvme
  with:
    guest_name: generic-bios-kvm-x86_64

- name: guest_check
  run: |
