/**
 * Hugepage-backed malloc-like allocator for DMA in userspace
 * ===========================================================
 *
 * This header provides a minimal, header-only allocator for use in user-space drivers
 * requiring DMA-capable memory. Allocations are backed by hugepages and are guaranteed
 * to be contiguous in both virtual and physical address space â€” up to hugepage granularity.
 *
 * Interface
 * ---------
 *
 *  - void *hostmem_dma_malloc(size_t size);
 *    Allocate a block of memory of the given size.
 *
 *  - void hostmem_dma_free(void *ptr);
 *    Frees a block previously returned by hostmem_dma_malloc().
 *
 *  - uint64_t hostmem_dma_v2p(void *virt);
 *    Resolve a virtual address to its corresponding physical address.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 * You must call `hostmem_dma_init()` before any allocation is made, and `hostmem_dma_term()` after
 * all memory has been freed. The allocator does not support lazy initialization.
 *
 * Caveats
 * -------
 *
 * - Physical contiguity is guaranteed only up to the system's hugepage size. On most systems, this
 *   is 2MB.
 *
 * - Sub-hugepage allocations may span multiple hugepages, resulting in reduced physical
 *   contiguity. This may be addressed in a future update.
 *
 * - Alignment is currently to the system's page size (typically 4KB).
 *
 * Roadmap
 * -------
 *
 * Planned improvements include:
 *
 *   - hostmem_dma_calloc() for zero-initialized memory
 *   - Sub-hugepage contiguity enforcement
 *
 * @file hostmem_dma.h
 * @version 0.1.1
