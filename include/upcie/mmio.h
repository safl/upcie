/**
 * Helpers for 32-bit and 64-bit MMIO read/write access
 * ====================================================
 *
 * This header provides simple functions for accessing memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) regions, typically
 * used for interacting with device registers on PCIe devices. The accessors use `volatile`
 * semantics to prevent the compiler from reordering or eliminating memory operations that may have
 * side effects at the hardware level.
 *
 * These functions assume that MMIO registers are little-endian, as is standard on most PCIe
 * devices. No byte-swapping is performed. As such, this library is not suitable for use on
 * big-endian systems without modification.
 *
 * This implementation has been verified only on x86 systems and may require additional memory
 * barriers or platform-specific instructions to work reliably on weakly ordered architectures
 * (e.g., ARM). The user is responsible for ensuring correct ordering when porting to such
 * platforms.
 *
 * The `region` pointer typically refers to the base of a memory-mapped PCI BAR (e.g., from `struct
 * pci_func_bar.region`), obtained via UIO, VFIO, or similar mechanisms.
 *
