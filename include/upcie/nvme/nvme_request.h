/**
 * NVMe Request Abstraction
 * ========================
 *
 * This header defines a minimal software abstraction for managing NVMe command identifiers (CIDs)
 * in user space. The abstraction uses a fixed-size pool of `struct nvme_request`, each assigned a
 * CID, along with a freelist-based allocator for constant-time allocation and release.
 *
 * This is not part of the NVMe specification, but is useful for tracking user-submitted commands
 * while they are in flight and associating user-defined metadata with each command.
 *
 * Caveat
 * ------
 *
 * assert() is used here. thus instead of a segfault, you will get a nice message like::
 *
 *   nvme_request_get: Assertion `cid < NVME_REQUEST_POOL_LEN' failed.
 *
 * Of course, this comes at a cost, so, make sure e.g. meson disables assert on release builds.
 *
 * The stack implementation has an upper-bound of NVME_REQUEST_POOL_LEN elements.
 *
 * @file nvme_request.h
 * @version 0.3.1
